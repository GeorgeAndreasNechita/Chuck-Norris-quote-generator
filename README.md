Very small project I was requested to do as a coding assesment for a job position.

It uses some new technologies that I never used like Next.js, React and Prisma for the database.
The styling is done with Tailwind, which I already knew.

It takes Chuck Norris quotes from an api and displays them, and also counts the number of visitors using the prisma database.
