Small and simple test project I was requested to do as a coding assesment for a job position.

This is the schema I got and the technology stack I had to use was the following:
Next.js + React, Tailwind, Prisma
The complexity in this project came with the fact that I have never used Next.js, React or Prisma, and had to learn enough to complete this project.

A random quote from the "dev" category had to be drawn from https://api.chucknorris.io/ via API. It should be possible to replace the quote with a new random one using a button.

The number of visitors is displayed on the footer.

This is the final result. I also made it responsible using tailwind classes.
